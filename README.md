# Brother Speedio Post Processor

Customized [Autodesk Fusion](https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmposts) post processor for the **Brother Speedio U500XD2-5AX** (CNC-D00v control, 16K RPM, CTS, 28-tool magazine, Renishaw probe).

The upstream post (`brother_speedio.cps`) is a generic post that covers the entire Speedio family — S, W, R, U, F, and H series. Its defaults target older controls (CNC-B00/C00) and the most conservative settings. This repo tracks a customized version tuned for the D00v control and the U500XD2-5AX's specific capabilities.

## What's changed

See [CUSTOMIZATIONS.md](CUSTOMIZATIONS.md) for the full list with rationale. In short:

- **M298 smoothing with Mode B fallback** — The D00 control uses the M298 Ln system for high-accuracy mode, not the legacy M260/M269 codes. Smoothing is set to automatic with L6 for finishing surfaces. Since M298 is incompatible with G43.4/G43.5 TCP, multi-axis sections automatically use Mode B (M280-M287) instead — the only smoothing mode the D00 allows during TCP.
- **G68.2 tilted workplane** — Required for [3+2 positional machining](https://plasticranger.com/g68-2-cnc-code/) on the 5-axis trunnion table.
- **Safe start block** — Outputs `M299` and `G69` at program start to cancel residual M298 machining mode and workplane rotation from previously aborted programs.
- **Washdown coolant** — Enabled between operations for chip management in the enclosed work area.
- **Clamp codes** — Outputs M443/M441 clamp commands for rigidity during indexed 3+2 work.
- **Double tap withdraw** — Takes advantage of the 16K spindle for faster G77 tapping cycles.
- **Safe probing** — All rapid moves with the probe active use G65 P8810 (protected positioning with G31 P2 skip-on-trigger) instead of bare G0. Stops with a PATH OBSTRUCTED alarm if the probe contacts anything during approach, preventing probe damage from wrong WCS.
- **Stuck chips detection** — Optional M318 output at program start to monitor Z-axis load during tool changes and detect debris between spindle face and tool holder.

## Options

These properties can be toggled in Fusion's post processor dialog:

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Enable safe probing | ON | Uses protected positioning (O8810) for all probe approach moves instead of G0 rapid. Prevents probe damage if WCS is wrong. Disable for maximum speed in production when you trust your WCS. |
| Stuck chips detection | OFF | Outputs M318 at program start to enable Z-axis load monitoring during tool changes. Only useful once your magazine tool lineup is stable — frequent tool swaps cause false alarms against the learned baselines. |

## Smoothing level mapping

The post is set to **Automatic** smoothing, which selects the M298/Mode B level based on the operation's stock-to-leave in Fusion. Multi-axis TCP sections automatically use Mode B (M280-M287) instead of M298 since they are mutually exclusive on the D00 control.

### Automatic mode (stock-to-leave thresholds)

| Fusion stock-to-leave | Category | 3-axis (M298) | 5-axis TCP (Mode B) |
|---|---|---|---|
| >= 0.5mm (or face op) | Roughing | M298 L2 | M285 |
| 0.1 – 0.5mm | Semi-roughing | M298 L3 | M283 |
| 0.05 – 0.1mm | Semi-finishing | M298 L4 | M281 |
| < 0.05mm (or 0) | Finishing | M298 L6 | M282 |

Probing and drilling cycles always skip smoothing regardless of the setting.

### Manual override

If `useSmoothing` is changed from Automatic to a fixed level in the post properties:

| Property value | M298 level | Mode B code |
|---|---|---|
| Off | _(no output)_ | _(no output)_ |
| Standard | M298 L0 | M280 |
| Roughing | M298 L1 | M285 |
| Medium rough | M298 L2 | M283 |
| Medium rough high | M298 L3 | M284 |
| Finishing | M298 L4 | M281 |
| Finishing high | M298 L5 | M282 |

Note: manual override uses raw level numbers (0-5), which differ from the automatic mode levels (2, 3, 4, 6). Automatic is recommended — it picks the right level per operation based on your CAM setup.

## Updating to a new upstream version

```bash
bash update.sh
```

This downloads the latest post from the [Autodesk post library](https://cam.autodesk.com/hsmposts), extracts the JavaScript source, and saves it as `brother_speedio.cps`. After updating, review [CUSTOMIZATIONS.md](CUSTOMIZATIONS.md) and re-apply the changes.
